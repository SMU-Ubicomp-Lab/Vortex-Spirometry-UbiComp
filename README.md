# Vortex-Spirometry-UbiComp
This is a repository for the open-sourced Vortex Spirometry work which was presented at UbiComp 2016

## Coming Soon
We aren't ready to release all of the data and truly open source the project but we're working on it! Star the project if you want an easy way to find it later.



When we're able to, we will upload the source code for the iOS coaching app, the anonymized human subjects trial data, the data from the Pulmonary Waveform Generator, and the .STL files for the whistle itself.
